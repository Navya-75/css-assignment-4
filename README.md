# HTML Image Gallery Projects

This repository contains two simple and responsive HTML projects demonstrating the use of CSS and HTML for presenting image galleries.

## 📁 Contents

- `task1.html`: A **Photo Gallery** displaying a 2-row, 4-column layout of various images like nature, animals, and objects.
- `task2.html`: A **Music World** themed webpage featuring a navigation bar and two image tables — one showcasing best albums and the other top 10 songs.

## 🖼️ Images

All necessary image files (e.g., `butterfly.jpg`, `concert.jpg`, `avara album.jpg`, etc.) are included in the repository. Ensure that the image filenames are **not changed**, or the HTML files may not display them correctly.
